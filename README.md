# COMP2101

Project Name: COMP2101 Shell Scripting Project

This project contains two shell scripts - one written in PowerShell and one written in Bash - that were created as part of the COMP2101 course at Georgian College. The scripts were developed to demonstrate proficiency in shell scripting and to perform various tasks related to system administration.

Installation:

To use these scripts, you will need to have either PowerShell or Bash installed on your system. The scripts can be downloaded from this repository or cloned using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/projal07/COMP2101.git

Usage:

PowerShell Script:

The 'powerShellScript.ps1' script can be run using PowerShell. It performs the following tasks:

- Displays the current time and date.
- Checks if a specified folder exists and creates it if it doesn't.
- Copies a specified file to the folder.
- Checks if the file was successfully copied and displays a success or failure message.

To run the script, open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Then, enter the following command:

.\powerShellScript.ps1

Bash Script:

The 'bashScript.sh' script can be run using Bash. It performs the following tasks:

- Prompts the user for a name and displays a welcome message.
- Displays the current time and date.
- Checks if a specified folder exists and creates it if it doesn't.
- Copies a specified file to the folder.
- Checks if the file was successfully copied and displays a success or failure message.
